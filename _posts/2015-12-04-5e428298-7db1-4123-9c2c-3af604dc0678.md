"Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?"

[Ugarte][1]

"Myself. I found myself much more reasonable."

Just Like Rik and Ugarte I am deep into visas and official documents for the moment.

Of course there is the Ã¼ber important  work permit in Morocco. Luckily my new employer has some experience and will manage the whole process for me. 

At the same time I need to descend into my own catacombs and find diplomas from long forgotten times, certificates and other stuff that most people put away in a box and forget about it... Yep, I completely forgot where those things are.

But of course, at the end, I'll be an official immigrant in Morocco and a perfect emigrant for Belgium.
